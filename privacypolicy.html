      <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Companion</h1>

      <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Companion</strong> does not collect, store, or transmit any
        personally identifiable information (PII) without your consent. The
        Extension may access specific data solely to provide its core
        functionality and improve your user experience.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Types of Data Collected:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Certain usage data (e.g., feature usage
          statistics, error reports) may be collected to enhance the Extension’s
          performance. This data is anonymized and not linked to you personally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speech Data</strong> _(If applicable)_: If using
          speech-to-text or similar features, audio data may be processed
          temporarily on your device but is not saved or transmitted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
      <p>Any data collected is used solely to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve and optimize the Extension's performance.</li>
        <li>Provide core functionalities as advertised.</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with security standards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not share, sell, or lease any collected data to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension may integrate with third-party APIs or services (e.g., for
        speech-to-text, analytics, or cloud services). These services may
        collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage
        you to review the privacy policies of these services before enabling
        them in the Extension.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take data security seriously and employ industry-standard practices
        to safeguard data, such as anonymizing collected data and using
        encrypted channels for data transfers when necessary.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect or retain personal data, there is no data to
        access, correct, or delete. Should this change in the future, users will
        be notified and granted the right to request data access, correction, or
        deletion as per legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If significant changes
        are made, we will notify users through the Extension or by updating the
        “Last updated” date.
      </p>
